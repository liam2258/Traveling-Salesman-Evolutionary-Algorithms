# Traveling-Salesman-Evolutionary-Algorithms
A program to solve the traveling salesman problem using evlotionary algorithms.

The program constructs a city grid, randomly generated travel fair (between $99 and $2000), and a starting population of routes.
Using the parameters listed in the tableau it runs 12 total times using 12 different populations to find the cheapest travel route.
3 runs for each of the 4 mutations tested, insert, scramble, swap, and inversion.

Each generation and it's fitness is displayed along with the fittest route of that generation and the fittest route of the whole run.
